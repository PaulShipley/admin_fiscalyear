Fiscal Years Replacement

I have created an extension module to provide an alternative Fiscal Years admin.

The module can be downloaded from:
https://github.com/PaulShipley/admin_fiscalyear

Install by copying to [fa root dir]/modules, then install Fiscal Years Replacement extension and activating it for company(s).

Refer to:
http://frontaccounting.com/fawiki/index.php?n=Help.InstallActivateExtensions

There will be a Fiscal Years Replacement entry on the right hand side of Company Setup under the Setup tab.
